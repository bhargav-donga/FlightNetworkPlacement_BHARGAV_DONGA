 
Approach to first program...

# In this problem we have to implement Stack like functionality but with some restriction about data entry.
# Stack functionality is implemented using LINKED LIST in C language.
# Restriction about the next data that is to be entered is implemented usding IF ELSE statements.
# PUSH and POP operations are written under SWITCH CASE block for easy user interaction.
# Popped out nodes are deleted from stack and then linked to another linked list containg all popped out nodes in sequence.
# popped out values are then printed in order they were popped from the stack.
